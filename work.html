        <h3>May-June 2021</h3>
        <p>We were asked by Ortum Games to provide testing on their upcoming mobile game, Belt It Out!, and provide feedback on the experience of playing the game and it's graphics. They wanted their game to be fast paced, engaging, and visually stimulating. We began planning our work, doing initial exploratory sprints to familiarise ourselves with the game early on. We then researched the market for games that were similar and better, and took notes on what made Belt It Out! different.</p>

        <h3>March-April 2021</h3>
        <p>When our team was contacted by Everty EV Charge Management in March, we didn't know what to expect! We learned in an interview with the CEO that the company needed testing for their mobile app and web app, saying that they were concerned about the user experience not being "slick" and "smooth" compared to their competitors. We immediately got to work, downloading the app and checking it's specifications. We plotted out a user journey, looking identify a simple linear path that an average user would follow. A user would find and download the app, then use the map to locate a station in Everty's network, drive to it, charge their car, and then pay for the power that they used.<br>
        Our next move was to attempt a user journey from start to finish, we learned of an Everty charge station near where we worked and we conducted a field trip, to see if we could actually find a real station using the mobile app, and how smooth the experience was.We followed this up by doing more in depth with opposition research. After finding their competitors online, each of us downloaded one of the apps we found, as well as the third party PlugShare app as an added benchmark. We were able to find out exactly why Everty were concerned about how their app performed and present it in an easy to read <a href="">Feature Comparison spreadsheet</a>, along with a mind map, a form of visual flowchart.<br>
        Additionally, we did more in depth bug hunting of both the mobile app, as well as their management Dashboard, to make sure there were no integration issues between the two apps. With our research, <a href="">bug report</a>, and spreadsheet completed, we gave a presentation to Everty's CEO and Development lead, informing them of what we learned, identifying four notable pain points in the app's design.</p>
