        <h2>Comtrove</h2>
        <em>Web Testing, UI/UX</em>
        <h3>May-June 2021</h3>
        <p>Comtrove, an upcoming startup providing a platform for organisations to plan and coordinate their communication with the media asked us to test their website with no specification. We read the short documentation we were given to understand the company's claims about it's site and get our authentication credentials, then we began doing exploratory testing shortly after. We tested the permissions of different users, we tested the data entry and forms, as well as the downloads. We also heavily evaluated the User Interface of the website.<br><br>
        We compiled the bugs and questions that we gathered from our test sessions using a Trello Board which we shared with the Test Lead at Comtrove. We also took on bugs that she had presented to us and made test cases to learn more about the bug and help the development team find the cause.</p>

        <h2>Ortum Games</h2>
        <em>Game Testing</em>
        <h3>May-June 2021</h3>
        <p>We were asked by Ortum Games to provide testing on their upcoming mobile game, Belt It Out!, and provide feedback on the experience of playing the game and it's graphics. They wanted their game to be fast paced, engaging, and visually stimulating. We began planning our work, doing initial exploratory sprints to familiarise ourselves with the game early on. We then researched the market for games that were similar and better, and took notes on what made Belt It Out! different.</p>

        <h2>Everty</h2>
        <em>Web Testing, Mobile Testing</em>
        <h3>March-April 2021</h3>
        <p>My first testing job, in which I worked with a startup at Fishburners to test an EV charging app and do research, providing feedback on how to improve their app from a UI/UX perspective using a User Journey, Feature Comparison, and Exploratory Testing.</p>

        <h2>BringItHome</h2>
        <em>Web Development</em>
        <h3>June 2021</h3>
        <p>I am currently working on a web development project for BringItHome, an effort to bring IT jobs to Rural Australians and create Job Oppurtunities in disadvantaged communities that have been squandered by youth unemployment and natural disasters in recent years. As the site is powered by Wordpress, I've found the project very instructive and interesting.

        <h2>ThreatGen: Red vs Blue</h2>
        <em>Game Testing</em>
        <h3>April 2021</h3>
        <p>In April of 2021, I was asked to review and test the game ThreatGen: Red vs. Blue and report on it's value as a potential Cybersecurity learning tool and as an entertaining game. ThreatGen is a competitive game between two players, or one player and a computer. One player takes the Blue Team and acts as a Security Consultant for a company and it's network, while the other takes the Red Team and acts as a malicious hacker looking to break into that network and sabotage the company's industrial systems. I played the game several times to familiarise myself with the gameplay loop, including multiplayer games against a fellow tester.<br><br>
        After we were familiar with what the game had to say about cybersecurity, we looked to the expertise of Vertex Cyber Security, a cybersecurity firm working in Fishburners alongside us, we interviewed them and showed them the game to get their impressions and confirm or clarify what we had learned. Their comments allowed me to learn a lot about cybersecurity, and also to get a better idea on how the game could be used as an educational tool. They confirmed that the game referenced actual methods and vulnerabilities found in networks.</p>
